# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
The key problem is classifying opinions on E commerce websites as positive or negative opinions. I am focusing on classifying the reviews given to the Video Games on Amazon as ‘Like’ or ‘Don’t Like’ based on sentiment analysis algorithms.

This project uses python script for Data preparation and WEKA tool for data mining.
